## Estimation and inference of a directed acyclic graph with unspecified interventions

This repository contains an implementation of the paper [*Inference for a Large Directed Acyclic Graph with Unspecified Interventions*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03805).

Specifically, it offers 

- an R package `glmtlp` for l0-constrained regression and 

- an R package `intdag` for the peeling causal discovery method and data-perturbation/asymptotic inference.

**Installation guide to be added.**

**Examples to be added.**

Implementing these algorithms is error-prone and this code project is still in development. 
Please file an issue if you encounter any error when using the code. I will be grateful to be informed.
